# Email Spam Classifier

I'm excited to share my latest project, an Email Spam Classifier developed using machine learning techniques! This project was completed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte, where I worked on enhancing the existing SMS classifier into an email classifier.

## Project Overview

The Email Spam Classifier is a machine learning model that distinguishes between spam and non-spam (ham) emails with high accuracy. The classifier is built using Python, NLTK for text preprocessing, and Streamlit for the user interface. The model was trained on a dataset of spam and non-spam emails, achieving an accuracy of 97% on the test dataset.

## Features

- Text preprocessing using NLTK for removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing stemming.
- Model training using machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- User-friendly interface using Streamlit for inputting email messages and displaying the classification result.

## Usage

To use the Email Spam Classifier, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit application using `streamlit run APP1.py`.
4. Input an email message into the application to classify it as spam or not spam.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate more advanced machine learning models for improved classification accuracy.
- Implement email filtering functionality to automatically move spam emails to a separate folder.
- Add support for multiple languages and different email formats.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Oasis Infobyte for providing me with the opportunity to work on this project and for their guidance and support throughout the internship.

## Conclusion

The Email Spam Classifier project has been a challenging yet rewarding experience. It has not only improved my skills in machine learning and natural language processing but has also given me valuable insights into the world of email filtering and classification. I look forward to applying these skills to future projects and contributing to the field of data science.
